You’ll need to create API routes to handle searches and retrieve recordings. Below are some suggestions for the API routes:

	1.	Search Recordings by Email, Participant, Topic, Meeting ID, and Dates
	•	Endpoint: GET /recordings
	•	Parameters:
	•	email_query (string)
	•	transcript_query (string)
	•	start_date (date)
	•	end_date (date)

Step 3: Backend Logic

Implement logic to handle these queries and interact with the Zoom API to fetch recordings based on the provided parameters.

Step 4: Frontend Integration

Integrate the search functionality in the frontend to make calls to the backend and display results in a table format similar to Zoom’s recording tab interface.

Step 5: Pagination and Result Count

Ensure the frontend displays the total number of results and supports pagination if there are multiple pages of results.

Step 6: Error Handling and User Feedback

Implement error handling and user feedback mechanisms to handle cases where no recordings are found or when there are API errors.
